# Kenility Code Challenge

```
A new company needs to address these requirements:
- Create a Node API with Typescript.
- Connect the Node API to MongoDB using mongoose (desirable models in typescript).

We need to develop three endpoints behind a basic authentication (username and password).
- Create a user with name, last name, address, and profile picture (this should be a file).
- Retrieve users.
- Update user.
Star point: Dockerize MongoDB and the Node API, solved with Nest.js
